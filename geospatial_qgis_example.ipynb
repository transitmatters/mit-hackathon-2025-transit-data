Also see specific tutorials on [demographics](demographics_geospatial.ipynb) and [geospatial MBTA network data](mbta_network_geospatial.ipynb)._"

    "## What is GIS?\n",
    "\n",
    "Geographic information system (GIS) is the generic name for geospatial data formats. GIS data represents spatial features, such as points, lines, and polygons, linked to descriptive or numeric attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one dataset may contain all rapid transit stations as points, each with attributes such as station name, the line that it's on, and accessibility score. Another data layer might contain polygons of US Census block groups, with information of its population, transit share, etc. These layers can then be combined or processed to understand spatial relationships between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different GIS data formats, such as Shapefile, GeoJSON and GeoPackage. While external data sources we link to may provide the data in different formats, pre-processed datasets provided by TransitMatters will mostly use GeoPackage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyses of GIS data typically take two forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using dedicated GIS software, such as [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) (free, open-source) or [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html) (commercial).\n",
    "* Process them with code, such as in Python and R. The Python package ``geopandas`` can read GIS data as ``GeoDataFrames`` objects: they are similar to regular ``pandas.DataFrames``, but with additional geometry columns."
