    "\n",
    "In Massachusetts, a [municipality](https://gis.data.mass.gov/maps/4b532722f22d43ce9003cb1d118d89cc/explore) is either a **city** (e.g. the City of Boston, the City of Cambridge) or a **town** (e.g. the Town of Brookline). Each municipality has its own government, often with a mayor, a city council, or a town representative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term [**\"Greater Boston\"**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Boston) is often used to describe the whole metropolitan region (of varying sizes). This includes, but is not limited to, the City of Boston – which is itself just one of many municipalities in Greater Boston, albeit the most populated one. A more detailed comparison will be shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common definition of the **\"urban\"** region of Greater Boston (in contrast to suburban) is [Massachusetts Route 128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Route_128), a circumferential highway. Most of Route 128 is concurrent with interstate I-95."

Its [**Extended Service Area**](https://mbta-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/ec170028b45e46cea43dd51bda250237_0/explore) is a larger set of 178 cities and towns, which adds those for which _commuter rail_ service is provided (or adjacent).\n",

    "\n",
    "As alluded to above, the City of Boston is one of the many municipalities in the Greater Boston metropolitan area and the MBTA service areas, albeit large in size and the most populous. The [City of Boston's official neighborhoods](https://gis.data.mass.gov/datasets/fefd5fb156d9419e80a3944a62bd64ab_1/explore) contain many _dissolved municipalities_, especially well south of Downtown Boston.

Meanwhile, many non-Boston municipalities such as Cambridge are important hubs in the downtown core by themselves, and already receive rapid transit service.\n",
