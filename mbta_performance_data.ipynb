    "In the early 2020s, the MBTA had imposed many speed restrictions on the rail rapid transit network due to faulty tracks, often as a consequence of deferred maintenance. Since 2022, TransitMatters has been reporting \"slow zones\" on their [Data Dashboard](https://dashboard.transitmatters.org/) using automated analyses of travel time data, drawing great public attention. MBTA eventually released an official [Speed Restrictions Dashboard](https://www.mbta.com/performance-metrics/speed-restrictions), sourced directly from internal records, in January 2023.\n",

    "Later in 2023, the MBTA launched its [Track Improvement Program](https://www.mbta.com/projects/track-improvement-program) that aimed to eliminate all speed restrictions through extensive track work, often involving lengthy closures of parts of the system. The program was eventually completed in December 2024, and the official Speed Restrictions Dashboard is no longer updated since December 22, 2024.\n",

    "A CSV table of [speed restrictions by day](https://mbta-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d73ed67e4cc84a84b818ea2c5caef696/about) is available on the MBTA Open Data Portal. It also contains data in 2025, when some small-scale speed restrictions may still exist in the system, some of which were later removed by ongoing track repairs."
